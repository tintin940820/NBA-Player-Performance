# Project Title

This project explores how physical attributes like height and weight relate to NBA draft outcomes.

## Overview

We analyze draft and player profile data to uncover patterns in physical traits and draft position. Using visualizations and summary statistics, we investigate how height and weight may influence when a player is selected in the draft and identify general trends across draft rounds.

### Interesting Insight

The most interesting insight I found is that in recent years, teams that hold the top pick tends to use it to draft players that are shorter in height. If we actually look into the recent drafts, players like Cade Cunningham, Markelle Fultz, Kryie Irving, etc. They tend to use the top pick to draft guards that have a strong performance at college, which i thought teams would more likely choose taller player at top pick. 


## Repo Structure

The structure of our repo is a qmd file and the rendered pdf, which is our main work. Besides that, we have our data set uploaded and our presentation slides. We all work together on this project outside of class. So the work is equally distributed. 

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

We got our data from google from websites such as Kaggle.com and NBA.com, all sources are reliable and official

## Open Science Reflection

This project follows the principles of Open Science in several ways:

- **Transparency and Reproducibility**: All data, code, and results are included in this public GitHub repository. Our `.qmd` file documents each step from import to visualization so others can reproduce the analysis.
- **Equality of Opportunity**: The project uses publicly available data, and all tools used (R, Quarto) are open-source and accessible to anyone.
- **Responsibility and Accountability**: All analysis is based on official public data sources, and each team member contributed equally to ensure fair and ethical reporting.
- **Collaboration and Inclusion**: The work was completed collaboratively by all three authors. We used GitHub and group meetings to coordinate our work and ensure everyone's contributions were valued.
- **Flexibility**: We approached the analysis iteratively, improving our code and visuals based on feedback and exploration. Our structure supports others adapting the project for related research.
- **Sustainability**: We used reproducible workflows and organized our files so future users or teammates can build on this work without starting from scratch.
