# Project Title

This project explores how physical attributes like height and weight relate to NBA draft outcomes.

## Overview

We analyze draft and player profile data to uncover patterns in physical traits and draft position. Using visualizations and summary statistics, we investigate how height and weight may influence when a player is selected in the draft and identify general trends across draft rounds.

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.
